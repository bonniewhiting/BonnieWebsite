                <p>“Virtuoso hardly covers it; Whiting convinces us there is nobody better to interpret this music... a
                    recording of the utmost power and clarity.”</p>

                <p>“American Bonnie Whiting. . .has distinguished herself in this field for her constant didactic and
                    performative commitment. . . [Susan Parenti's work] undoubtedly presents the most radical and
                    demanding
                    mixture of vocal registers and approaches: unfolding like a whirling scherzo among hints of
                    solfeggio,
                    whistles, coughs, but also operatic singing and sudden falsettos, concomitant with acrobatics
                    nonetheless insidious in terms of physical coordination. It's the crowning pinnacle of a “recital”
                    as
                    unusual as it is intriguing, perhaps the first of its kind.”</p>
                <p>— Michele Palozzo (Esoteros), on <i>Perishable Structures</i></p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <p>“An effort that's appreciated for both its percussive and spoken elements and that bridges the gap
                    between the two mediums with an abstract and always exciting execution, Whiting pulls off an
                    ambitious endeavor.” </p>

            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <p>“As Whiting suggests, effective avant-garde music need not be “highbrow” and all that term
                    represents — even when attacks on science, academia, thoughtfulness, and subtlety are on the rise,
                    and the negative connotation of a word like “elite” is taken as a given, “difficult music,” as
                    Laurie
                    Anderson might say, is still simply the work of ordinary human beings, albeit with a taste for the
                    esoteric. . .As Whiting's work makes clear, we who hit things to make sound for a living can be
                    ideal
                    communicators, particularly when we open our mouths at the same time.”</p>

                <p>Second Inversion:</p>
                <p>“Whiting's light and agile speaking voice offers a refreshing contrast to the male voices that have
                    traditionally dominated recordings of this kind of piece, and the feat of covering both vocal and
                    instrumental roles at the same time is an impressive tour de force. Listening to it is like
                    imagining
                    Gertrude Stein deliver a lecture on modern music in a room occupied by a crazy robotic drum
                    corps.”</p>

                <p>The Whole Note:</p>
                <p>“Whiting performs. . .with ease and grace. In [her] relaxed, naturalistic yet precise performances
                    the
                    songs feel almost lullaby-like, equally timeless and emblematic of the 20th-century avant-garde.”

                <p>Mundoclasico:</p>
                <p>“Whiting has a sweet and pointed voice, with a certain naivete that gives both songs a fabulated
                    touch, something that is reinforced by the very delicate percussion of the piano lid subtly attacked
                    with the fingers of the singer- percussionist.”</p>

                <p>Musik an sich:</p>
                <p>“Revolutionary sensitivity. . . I have no doubt that [Cage] would have been delighted with Whiting's
                    unflagging virtuosity and all-natural acting. . .[S]he accepts the challenge and conjures up the
                    most
                    wondrous percussion sounds on a really colorful ensemble of various utensils, some of which are
                    borrowed from the kitchen, and at the same time recites a whole collection of Cage text fragments
                    in 51'15.657 ." [It is] as if she just came up with them on the spot - that's really impressive.
                    Music for
                    Two also requires other vocal sound utterances - and here too Whiting convinces, because these
                    elements always seem musically felt.”</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Perishable Structures places works for speaking percussionist within a
                        context of storytelling. Through works by Frederic Rzewski, Vinko Globokar, Susan Parenti,
                        Richard Logan-Greene, and Whiting herself, the album investigates the intertwined relationship
                        between spoken and musical narrative and the unique role that percussion plays in this
                        repertoire.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">John Cage allowed for some of his works to be combined and performed
                        simultaneously. Whiting has created uniquely virtuosic solo-simultaneous realizations of some of
                        these works for “speaking percussionist,” presented here as the fourth installment of Mode
                        Records' complete John Cage Works for Percussion series. At 54 volumes, Mode's John Cage Edition
                        is the largest collection of the composer's music on one label.</p>

                    <p>Sound Expeditions (track: Control/Resist)</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 12px;">The Indiana State Capitol is a site that relates to both state and
                        federal politics, and is a location that contains the duality of action for both government and
                        protest. The tensions of this duality are captured through overlaid percussion techniques in
                        Control/Resist. This track is a musical expression of two sides of political action: (1) the
                        private daily work of sustained resistance; and (2) the less frequent act of public
                        demonstration and shared experience. The rhythm of the work is a transcription of a text from a
                        mesostic poem (a poem where the text is arranged so that the vertical phrase intersects the line
                        of a horizontal text). This is a poem Whiting created that emerges from versions of an online
                        resistance syllabus. Beneath this score are recordings of daily percussion practice on different
                        instruments at different tempos. Crowdsourced noises from the Indianapolis Women's March on
                        January 20, 2017 at the west side plaza of the Indiana Statehouse combine with granular metallic
                        percussion sounds and white noise to dominate the soundscape and replicate these moments of
                        energetic resistance.</p>
