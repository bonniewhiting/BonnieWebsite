                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Perishable Structures places works for speaking percussionist within a
                        context of storytelling. Through works by Frederic Rzewski, Vinko Globokar, Susan Parenti,
                        Richard Logan-Greene, and Whiting herself, the album investigates the intertwined relationship
                        between spoken and musical narrative and the unique role that percussion plays in this
                        repertoire.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">John Cage allowed for some of his works to be combined and performed
                        simultaneously. Whiting has created uniquely virtuosic solo-simultaneous realizations of some of
                        these works for “speaking percussionist,” presented here as the fourth installment of Mode
                        Records' complete John Cage Works for Percussion series. At 54 volumes, Mode's John Cage Edition
                        is the largest collection of the composer's music on one label.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12px;">The Indiana State Capitol is a site that relates to both state and
                        federal politics, and is a location that contains the duality of action for both government and
                        protest. The tensions of this duality are captured through overlaid percussion techniques in
                        Control/Resist. This track is a musical expression of two sides of political action: (1) the
                        private daily work of sustained resistance; and (2) the less frequent act of public
                        demonstration and shared experience. The rhythm of the work is a transcription of a text from a
                        mesostic poem (a poem where the text is arranged so that the vertical phrase intersects the line
                        of a horizontal text). This is a poem Whiting created that emerges from versions of an online
                        resistance syllabus. Beneath this score are recordings of daily percussion practice on different
                        instruments at different tempos. Crowdsourced noises from the Indianapolis Women's March on
                        January 20, 2017 at the west side plaza of the Indiana Statehouse combine with granular metallic
                        percussion sounds and white noise to dominate the soundscape and replicate these moments of
                        energetic resistance.</p>
