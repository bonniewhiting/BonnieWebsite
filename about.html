            <p id="bio-first"> Bonnie Whiting performs, commissions, and composes new experimental music for percussion.
                She seeks
                out projects involving non-traditional notation, interdisciplinary performance, improvisation, and
                the speaking percussionist. She lives and works in Seattle, WA, where she is Chair of Percussion
                Studies and the Ruth Sutton Waters Associate Professor at the University of Washington School of
                Music.</p>
            <p> Her debut album, featuring an original solo-simultaneous realization of John Cage's 45' for a
                speaker and 27'10.554” for a percussionist, was released by Mode Records in April of 2017. Her
                sophomore album Perishable Structures, launched by New Focus Recordings in 2020, places the speaking
                percussionist in the context of storytelling and features her own music as well as works by Vinko
                Globokar, Frederic Rzewski, Richard Logan-Greene, and Susan Parenti.</p>
            <p> Recent work includes performances as a percussionist and vocalist with the Harry Partch Ensemble on
                the composer's original instrumentarium, and a commission from the Indiana State Museum's Sonic
                Expeditions series for her piece Control/Resist: a site-specific work for percussion, field
                recordings, and electronics. She recently performed in the small chamber group premiering the
                multimedia opera The Ritual of Breath Is the Rite to Resist (co-commissioned by The Hopkins Center
                for the Arts at Dartmouth College, and Stanford Live at Stanford University.) Whiting has an ongoing
                relationship as a soloist with the National Orchestra of Turkmenistan via the U.S. Embassy Cultural
                Affairs Office, playing concerti in Ashgabat in 2017 and 2018. She performs frequently with
                percussionist Jennifer Torrence, giving concerts of new experimental work for speaking
                percussionists throughout Norway and the US. Her collaboration with multimedia artist Afroditi
                Psarra generated the album < null_abc>, released on the Zero Moon label in 2018, and their current
                    project with designer Audrey Desjardins on transcoding data from IoT devices as performance
                    received a 2019/20 Mellon Creative Fellowship. This project was explored in a workshop at the
                    2020 Transmediale Festival in Berlin, and currently lives as an interactive net art
                    installation. In 2022 she premiered Through the Eyes(s): an extractable cycle of nine pieces for
                    speaking/singing percussionist collaboratively developed with composer Eliza Brown and ten
                    incarcerated women, and gave the first performance of a new percussion concerto by Huck Hodge
                    with the Seattle Modern Orchestra. </p>
            <p> Whiting has presented solo and small ensemble shows at The Stone in New York, the Brackish Series in
                Brooklyn, The Lilypad in Boston, The New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, at Hallwalls in
                Buffalo, the Tiny Park Gallery in Austin, The Wulf in LA, the Carl Solway Gallery in Cincinnati, The
                Grove Haus in Indianapolis, on the Wayward Music Series in Seattle, on tour throughout New Zealand,
                and at colleges and universities around the country. Whiting is a core member of the Seattle Modern
                Orchestra and the Torch Quartet, and she has collaborated with many of today's leading new music
                groups, including red fish blue fish percussion group, (George Crumb's Winds of Destiny directed by
                Peter Sellars and featuring soprano Dawn Upshaw for the Ojai Festival), eighth blackbird (the
                “Tune-in” festival at the Park Avenue Armory), the International Contemporary Ensemble (on-stage
                featured percussionist/mover in Andriessen's epic Die Materie at the Park Avenue Armory, and the
                American premiere of James Dillon's Nine Rivers at Miller Theatre), Talea Ensemble (Time of Music
                Festival in Finland), Bang on a Can (Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians for the LA Philharmonic's

                        performative commitment. . . [Susan Parenti's work] undoubtedly presents the most radical and
                        demanding
                        mixture of vocal registers and approaches: unfolding like a whirling scherzo among hints of
                        solfeggio,
                        whistles, coughs, but also operatic singing and sudden falsettos, concomitant with acrobatics
                        nonetheless insidious in terms of physical coordination. It's the crowning pinnacle of a “recital”
                        as
                        unusual as it is intriguing, perhaps the first of its kind.”</p>

                    <p>“An effort that's appreciated for both its percussive and spoken elements and that bridges the gap
                        between the two mediums with an abstract and always exciting execution, Whiting pulls off an
                        ambitious endeavor.” </p>

                    <p>“As Whiting suggests, effective avant-garde music need not be “highbrow” and all that term
                        represents — even when attacks on science, academia, thoughtfulness, and subtlety are on the rise,
                        and the negative connotation of a word like “elite” is taken as a given, “difficult music,” as
                        Laurie
                        Anderson might say, is still simply the work of ordinary human beings, albeit with a taste for the
                        esoteric. . .As Whiting's work makes clear, we who hit things to make sound for a living can be
                        ideal
                        communicators, particularly when we open our mouths at the same time.”</p>

                    <p>Second Inversion:</p>
                    <p>“Whiting's light and agile speaking voice offers a refreshing contrast to the male voices that have
                        traditionally dominated recordings of this kind of piece, and the feat of covering both vocal and
                        instrumental roles at the same time is an impressive tour de force. Listening to it is like
                        imagining
                        Gertrude Stein deliver a lecture on modern music in a room occupied by a crazy robotic drum

                        the
                        songs feel almost lullaby-like, equally timeless and emblematic of the 20th-century avant-garde.”

                        touch, something that is reinforced by the very delicate percussion of the piano lid subtly attacked
                        with the fingers of the singer- percussionist.”</p>

                    <p>“Revolutionary sensitivity. . . I have no doubt that [Cage] would have been delighted with Whiting's
                        unflagging virtuosity and all-natural acting. . .[S]he accepts the challenge and conjures up the
                        most
                        wondrous percussion sounds on a really colorful ensemble of various utensils, some of which are
                        borrowed from the kitchen, and at the same time recites a whole collection of Cage text fragments
                        in 51'15.657 ." [It is] as if she just came up with them on the spot - that's really impressive.
                        Music for
                        Two also requires other vocal sound utterances - and here too Whiting convinces, because these
                        elements always seem musically felt.”</p>
