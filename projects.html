                    performing,
                    commissioning, composing, and championing music for the speaking and singing percussionist.
                    Exploring intersections of storytelling and experimental music, her work is often
                    cross-disciplinary,
                    integrating text, music, movement, and technology. Commission highlights include new music by
                    Wang Lu, Eliza Brown, Yiheng Yvonne Wu, Danny Clay, Jeffrey Treviño, Carolyn Chen, and
                    Nicholas Deyoe. Her repertoire includes classic works by Frederic Rzewski, John Cage, and Vinko
                    Globokar, trail-blazing historical work like the music of Susan Parenti, and her own compositions
                    and creative realizations. In 2021, Whiting co-curated the New Music/Research day at the
                    Percussive Arts Society International Convention (PASIC), including six concerts of music, a panel
                    discussion, and a virtual showcase.</p>

                    <p>Between 2019-2021, Whiting and composer Eliza Brown worked with a group of incarcerated
                        artists and writers at the Indiana Women's Prison on a 30-minute extractable cycle of songs for
                        solo
                        percussionist and voice. The collaboration centers the perspectives and artistic contributions
                        of
                        these individuals, allowing education to function as “epistemic reparations” for the injustices
                        incarcerated people experience. While this can manifest in many ways, in the realm of this
                        project,
                        it means using the arts as a space for incarcerated students to develop hermeneutic frames for
                        their
                        experience - that is, to shape their own narratives - and providing platforms for the creative
                        work
                        of incarcerated people to enter the public sphere with full authorial attribution.</p>

                        <p><strong>John Cage</strong> allowed for some of his works to be combined and performed
                            simultaneously. Whiting
                            has created uniquely virtuosic solo-simultaneous realizations of some of these works for a
                            single
                            speaking or singing percussionist. Recorded as the 4 th volume of Mode Records' complete
                            John
                            Cage Works for Percussion series, the centerpiece of this work is 51'15.657” for a speaking
                            percussionist:
                            Whiting's realization of 27'10.554” for a percussionist and Cage's iconic 45' for a speaker.
                            At
                            54 volumes,
                            Mode's John Cage Edition is the largest collection of the composer's music on one label. <a

                        <p>Whiting also joined <strong>The Harry Partch Ensemble</strong> in 2016 while the group was in
                            residence at the
                            University of Washington, and she continues to play with the ensemble now that it is

                            incorporated under the <a href="https://www.harrypartch.com/ensemble" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Partch Foundation</a>. This group performs exclusively
                            on
                            the original
                            instruments built by Partch himself, following his performative philosophies and unique
                            treatment
                            of the human voice. Experiencing Partch's music performed on these one-of-a-kind musical
                            sculptures offers a dramatic, intimate window into Partch's all-consuming artistic vision.
